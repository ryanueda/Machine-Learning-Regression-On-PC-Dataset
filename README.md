# Machine-Learning-Regression-On-PC-Dataset
Applications Of Multiple Machine Learning Regression Models On PC Dataset


## About The Project
The project aims to create and finetune multiple regression models in sklearn to predict PC prices based on their configuration details (computer parts and operating systems). The dataset consists of information regarding the PCs, as well as their prices (target variable)

This includes and not limited to:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing & Wrangling
- Model & Pipeline Building
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Feature Importance
